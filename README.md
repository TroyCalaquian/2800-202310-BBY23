# AI implementation
The ai was used throughout the project, helping us create, debug, and improve code, along with Sklearn being used in the product itself. The AI currently uses a dataset that helps it recommend songs to the user. There is a couple of limitations to the AI. We did plan on using tags to feed to the user, but the input has to be precise, which the Spotify API does. Because of this, tags had to be scrapped.
